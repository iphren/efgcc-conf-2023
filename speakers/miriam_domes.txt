Miriam Domes

Berlin Der Kreativen Church

I am Miriam from Berlin, I am married and we have 3 children.
I was saved by the grace of God 20 years ago.
It is my greatest joy to lead Christians and non believers
into the holy presence of God so that we can taste the goodness of God.
In his firy love he cleanses us and we become fully one with him.
